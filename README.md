## English Dictionary
A Python written, interactive English Dictionary.

Asks for a word and outputs definitions.

This was made following Ardit's python udemy course. Testing was not covered in this course, so all tests were written by me.

For the most part, this has been TDD'd. I still need to look into how to test input as the only failing test currently relies upon user input.

Things I'd like to improve upon in the future:
* Remove some of the logic out of the definition method
* Add a print/user interaction method
* Add a method that calls everything (main) and have it run upon loading the file
